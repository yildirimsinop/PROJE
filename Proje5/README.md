# Calculator Project

This project is a simple replica of a calculator, built to practice front-end web development, particularly HTML and CSS.

## Features
- Fully functional calculator layout
- Hover effects

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

calculator-project
|-- README.md
|-- index.html
|-- index.css


### index.html
The main HTML document contains the structure of the calculator, including the screen and various buttons.

### index.css
The CSS file where all the styles used in the project are defined. It includes the layout, color schemes, and hover effects.

## Usage
To use the calculator, open the index.html file in your web browser. You will see the calculator interface. Interactions such as hover effects can be observed.

> Note: This project does not actually perform mathematical calculations; it is only a front-end replica. For actual calculation functionality, you would need to integrate with JavaScript or another programming language.
