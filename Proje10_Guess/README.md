# Guess The Number Game

This is a fun and simple game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. 

## Project Structure

The project includes several important files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file responsible for the structure of the game. It includes a text input for entering your guess, a button to submit your guess, and a section to display messages back to the user.

- `style.css`: This file contains all the styles that make our game look nice. It includes styling for the main section, the input field, the button, and the message display section.

- `index.js`: This is where the game logic lives. It includes a function to check if the user's guess is correct and give feedback to help guide them to the correct answer.
