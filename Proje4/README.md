# Google Landing Page Project

This project is a replica of Google's landing page. It is designed to resemble the exact look and feel of Google's homepage, complete with functional search bar and clickable links. The purpose of the project is to practice front-end web development, especially HTML and CSS.

## Features

- Fully responsive layout
- Functional search bar
- Clickable links
- Navigation bar
- Footer with additional links

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```lua
google-landing-page
|-- README.md
|-- index.html
|-- index.css
|-- images
    |-- appicon.png
    |-- avataaars.png
    |-- googlelogo.png
    |-- Magnifying_glass_icon.png
    |-- google_microphone.png
    
### index.html

This is the main HTML document that contains the structure of the website. It includes the header, main, and footer sections.

### index.css

This is the CSS file where all the styles used in the project are defined. It styles elements in the HTML document to match the appearance of the original Google landing page.

### images

This directory contains all the images used in the project. These images are referenced in the HTML document via relative links.

## Usage

To view the webpage, open the index.html file in your web browser. You will see the Google landing page replica. You can interact with the page in the same way you would with the actual Google homepage.

> Note: This project does not actually search the web when you enter text into the search bar; it is only a front-end replica. For actual search functionality, you would need to integrate with a back-end search engine.
